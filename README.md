# REIT Valuation Tool
![App Interface](images/screenshot.png)

A Python desktop application for multi-model REIT valuation, combining three methodologies simultaneously with scenario analysis, sensitivity tables, and Google Sheets database management.
---

## Overview

The tool was built to support structured investment analysis of Real Estate Investment Trusts. It runs three independent valuation models side by side — DDM, AFFO DCF, and NAV — and produces a weighted cross-model summary that can be adjusted based on the REIT type. All analyses are saved to a Google Sheets database.

## Models

### 1. Two-Stage Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
- Stage 1: user-defined high-growth period (default 5 years)
- Stage 2: perpetual terminal growth rate
- Three scenarios: Worst / Base / Best
- Displays dividend coverage ratio (AFFO per share / DPS)

### 2. AFFO-Based DCF
- Discounted cash flow using Adjusted Funds from Operations
- Accounts for debt and cash in the equity bridge
- 10-year projection horizon (configurable)
- Three scenarios with independent WACC and terminal growth assumptions

### 3. Net Asset Value (NAV)
- NAV per share from Gross Asset Value, debt, and other liabilities
- Implied cap rate display (requires NOI input)
- **GAV sensitivity table**: NAV at ±10%, ±20% GAV
- **Cap rate sensitivity table**: NAV at cap rates from 3.5% to 6.5%
- Premium / discount to market price

## Features

- **Weighted cross-model summary** — configurable weights (DDM / AFFO DCF / NAV) with a weighted average price across all three scenarios
- **Weighting guide** — a few quick notes explaining when to favour each model
- **MoS and upside display** — margin of safety and % upside vs market price, colour-coded green/red
- **Google Sheets database** — save, load, and delete analyses; all inputs and weights are persisted
- **Reset** — clears all fields to defaults in one click

## Requirements

```
Python 3.9+
FreeSimpleGUI
gspread
google-auth
pandas (optional, not required at runtime)
```
Developed and tested on Linux. FreeSimpleGUI rendering may vary slightly when running on Windows and macOS.

## Google Sheets Setup

The tool writes to a Google Sheet named `DCF DB`, sheet `REIT DB` (change to whatever works for you).

1. Create a Google Cloud project and enable the Google Sheets and Drive APIs
2. Create a service account and download the JSON credentials file
3. Share the `DCF DB` spreadsheet with the service account email
4. Update `CREDENTIALS_PATH` in the script to point to your credentials file:

```python
CREDENTIALS_PATH = '/path/to/your/credentials.json'
```

The sheet header is written automatically on first save.

## Weighting Guide

| REIT Type | Recommended Weighting |
|---|---|
| Property-heavy (core, net lease) | NAV 50–60%, AFFO DCF 30%, DDM 10–20% |
| Dividend-focused (mREITs, high-yield) | DDM 40–50%, AFFO DCF 30%, NAV 20–30% |
| Balanced (residential, diversified) | Equal weights (33/34/33) |

NAV should carry more weight when the portfolio consists of readily appraised assets (apartments, industrial, retail) and when the REIT is in an operational transition where current cash flows understate intrinsic value. DDM deserves more weight when dividend sustainability and growth are the primary investment thesis.

## Notes

- The AFFO DCF can return negative equity values for highly leveraged REITs with low near-term AFFO — this is mathematically correct and represents the model's assessment that equity has no residual value at the given WACC. It is not a bug.
- Margin of Safety (MoS) displays `—` when intrinsic price is negative or zero.
- Cap rate sensitivity requires the NOI field to be populated.
- Weights do not need to sum to 100 — the weighted average normalises automatically.
